# presentations grow big
_if you do it correctly they stay appropriate_

people don't start presentations from scratch (to my experience)
they tend to use a prior presentation and remodel it to their needs
some may use the corp template which probably incl. a lot of images for background and styling
and has multiple slide layouts to choose from

ppt keeps all master slides and images there for future use
also pictures or other big files added (video, music, diagrams...) in your slides will make 
the final file size too big

if you only plan to use your presentation for web/online (as probably 99% of the cases)
then you should pay attention when saving

1) run the macro [ppt-slide-master-cleanup.bas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghofweber/msoffice-workarounds/master/macros/ppt-slide-master-cleanup.bas)
   you can just save without macro afterwards
2) save as -> compress pictures
as shown in screenshot below
