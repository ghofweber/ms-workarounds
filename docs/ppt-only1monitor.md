# present only on one monitor
_multi screen issue especially when presenting via webconf tools_

if you present sometimes with zoom, webex or other webconferencing tools
ppt presentations may sometimes not show remotely what you need

in case you are fine without the speaker view then I'd recommend
* uncheck the "Use Presenter View" 
* pin the presentation to a specific Monitor instead of "Automated"

that may save you some issues in presenting
